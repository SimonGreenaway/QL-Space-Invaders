The aim is as arcade accurate as possible, given hardware limitations. Written in pure qdos-gcc with no extra libraries, other than my own.

Executable and sprite library is in 'invaders.zip'. Copy to a floppy and unzip under QDOS, as per usual for the QL. Images supplied for floppy and microdrive emulators.

Keys:

	'c'	Insert a coin
	'1'	1 player game (if coin added)
	'2'	2 player game (if enough coins)
	'ESC'	Quit to QDOS.

In game:

	cursor left	move left
	cursor right	move right
	space		fire!
	'S'		Toggle sound on/off
	'ESC'		Quit to QDOS.
