Written in C68/xtc and uses treble buffered (!) sprites. Sprites are fully masked with the background and can be any size that is a multiple of 4 pixels for x, or anything for height. Data is pre-shifted into pixel locations for speed. 8 colour mode only is supported.

Executable and sprite library is in 'invaders.zip'. Copy to a floppy and unzip under QDOS, as per usual for the QL.
